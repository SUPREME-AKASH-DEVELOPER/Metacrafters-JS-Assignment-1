# Metacrafters-JS-Assignment-1
This JavaScript project creates a basic NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collection simulator. It features NFTs of football players, each with unique metadata such as player name, team, position, goals scored, and assists. The project includes functions to mint new NFTs, list all existing NFTs, and determine the total number of NFTs in the collection.
